# Simon-Says-Game
Built a Simon Says Memory Game with JavaScript!
Excited to share a recent mini project â€” a browser-based Simon Says game, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This classic memory game helped me bring together foundational web development skills through an interactive and playful experience.ðŸ’«
Throughout the project, I explored and applied key JavaScript concepts such as:

i. DOM Manipulation & Event Handling
ii. Game Logic with Arrays and Conditional Statements
iii. Reset flow and user interaction with time-based function
